# Spectrum Analyzer Tool
___
This is a tool that can be utilized to process video captures of specific spectrum analyzers in order to generate csv data representing signals displayed on the analyzer's display.

## Description
Engineers and analysts at the 402 SWEG Robbins AFB are responsible for verifying frequency and amplitude data from a video of a Spectrum Analyzer representing an Aircraft Electronic Warfare (EW) System Under Test (SUT). The test could be a calibration or a test of the EW response to threat systems. The goal of the project is to reduce the manual toil involved in the review process and allow the transcribed data to be manipulated and further analyzed for anomalies. The current software project plan will provide a path for completing and managing the development and delivery of the provided software solution. This plan functions as a software development road map. It outlines all the procedures and information required to develop the program, including what it should do, who will work on it, when it will be completed, and how much it will cost. It keeps things organized and aids with everyone's understanding of what must be done, ensuring that the program is finished effectively and on schedule.

## Usage
- Open the executable
- Press the **Select Video** button to select a proper video files
- Press the **Load Video** button to begin processing
- Once processing is complete, a file location within a prompt should be displayed to show the resulting csv filepath
